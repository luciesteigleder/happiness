# Welcome to Cheese-Happiness!

This is a small side project I developed, inspired by the digital display "Updating Happiness" from the "On Happiness" exhibition at the Wellcome foundation (https://updatinghappiness.com/#/).

The main idea behind this project was to experiment with user input and have some fun! And as a personal touch, I chose to focus on the product that brings me happiness: CHEESE!

## How does it work?

### First step:

Each time a question is answered and one of the two options is selected, a new CSS layer is added to the element on the right. This can be a color, shape, or pattern.

## How to run this project:

Simply answer the questions! You can refresh the page and try different options to see the differences.

## Self-reflection and future improvements:

### Quick fixes:

It's important to note that this project was quickly developed for a 10-minute showcase to my classmates, so it's not a finalized version. The first step towards improvement would be to enhance the user experience of the questions, allowing users to go back and start over if needed.
